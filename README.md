## 🚀 Installation

### Method 1 — Using an `<iframe>` (Recommended)

Easiest and safest option — keeps player code isolated.

1. Place `music_player.html` (or your built player file) somewhere in your project (e.g. `/components`).
2. Embed it just before `</body>`:

   ```html
   <!-- Responsive Music Player -->
   <iframe
     src="/components/music_player.html"
     style="
       border: none;
       position: fixed;
       bottom: 10px;
       right: 10px;
       left: 10px;
       width: auto;
       height: 75px;
       z-index: 1000;
     "
     title="Music Player"
   ></iframe>

   <style>
     @media (min-width: 900px) {
       iframe[title='Music Player'] {
         left: 20px;
         right: auto;
         width: 350px;
       }
     }
   </style>
   ```

✅ Ensure the `src` path correctly points to your `music_player.html`.

---

### Method 2 — Direct Embedding (Advanced)

For deeper control:

* Copy the `<link>` tags (fonts, icons) from `music_player.html` into your site’s `<head>`.
* Paste the `<style>` block into your CSS or within `<head>`.
* Insert the player markup:

  ```html
  <div id="music-player">…</div>
  <audio id="audio-player">…</audio>
  ```

  just before `</body>`.
* Append the `<script>` code right after those elements.

---

## 🎧 Playlist Setup

Configure your playlist via the `playlistData` array in the `<script>`:

```js
const playlistData = [
  {
    title: 'Song Title',
    artist: 'Artist Name',
    url: 'https://…/your-song.mp3',
    albumArtUrl: 'https://…/your-album-art.jpg'
  },
  // plus more songs...
];
```

Host your `.mp3` files somewhere accessible (GitHub Pages, your server, etc.), then reference them via URL.

---

## 🎨 Customization

At the top of your CSS (in the `<style>` block) you can tweak the look:

```css
:root {
  --primary-text: #ffffff;
  --secondary-text: #b3b3b3;
  --highlight-color: #1DB954;
  --panel-bg: rgba(25, 20, 20, 0.85);
  --font-stack: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
}
```

You can also extend or modify theme definitions in the `playerConfig.themes` object in the JS.
